#[Object objecness](for ICCV 2019)
It is an in-progress project to segment objects from 3D data in different scenes with no priori knowledge based on PointNet structure.

# [Compiler-2018](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/compiler2018)
This project is a Compiler whose source language is simplified C and target language is MIPS assembly, a course project for Compiler 2018(MS208), ACM Class 2016, SJTU. Written in 2018.

# [Visual Rhythm Prediction-2018](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/Visual-Rhythm-Prediction-with-Feature-Aligning-Network)
It is a paper for [ICMVA 2019](http://www.icmva.org/). In the project, we propose a data-driven visual rhythm prediction method, which overcomes the previous works' deficiency that predictions are made primarily by human-crafted hard rules. 

# [Item Recommendation-2018](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/item-recommendation)
It is a project for machine learning 2018(CS420), in which I constructed a recommender system to predict the preference score of the given user on the specific items.

# [E.P.A : Energy Profile Prediction And Analysis-2018](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/tiger_roses)
It is a project that provides a solution for problem C MCM/ICM, 2018. And my teammates are Jiuqin Zhou, Hongyu Yan. We were awarded as Meritorious Winner.

# [Mips-simulator-2017](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/Mips)
It is a C++ program that simulates five-stage pipeline to process MIPS instructions.

# [STL-2017]
It is a project designed three data structures in C++: [vector](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/vector),[map](https://github.com/honeyhaoyan/map) and deque which can be used in the same
way as in STL.

# [Teaching Experience-2018]
I served as a teaching assistant, designed part of the homework and exam problems and helped students with their problems about homework, in C++ Programming([CS152](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/wiki/Programming_2017)), 2018.
